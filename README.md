About BrainTrade
---------------------
BrainTrade is a peer learning network that allows users to trade expertise for free. Users can earn credits teaching others and then use their credits to learn something new from someone else.

Team and Group Process
---------------------
BrainTrade was created in 8 days as a student final project at Dev Bootcamp. Our team employed agile development practices (pair programming, iterations, user stories, daily standups) and GitHub workflow processes. We also used Trello boards to track team progress and HipChat to share ideas, code, and files.

Technologies
---------------------
This web application was developed using Ruby on Rails and tested with RSpec, Capybara and FactoryGirl. Front-end was designed with CSS3, Bootstrap and Javascript (JQuery, Ajax) and our database was managed with PostgreSQL.
